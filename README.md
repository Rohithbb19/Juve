implementation 

components in Juve
1. Navbar
2. Pagination
3. UserCard
4. UserList


I have used useEffect to fetch the data of the endpoint based on the change in the current page number
I have added separate files for different components and their CSS classes in order to maintain clean code and avoid CSS classes overlapping
